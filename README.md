# SmileAi
Grade 12 final individual project. This program, using either a prebuilt AI or one I made, detects smiles in faces through either inputted images or facecam.

The database used to train and test my AI was found from another smileDetection project off kaggle, along with other misc. images. 
More information can be found on the project doc. The only information used from said program is the dataset, the AI present there was not used as a reference for this project. 
My custom smile haarcascade xml was made with the help of a cascade trainer GUI, listed in the google doc.
All tutorials used in the creation of this project is listed in the google doc.

If my custom generated AI is having a hard time reading a face, for webcam move to a brighter area and look directly at the camera.
It works best with the head slightly tilted downwards. For images ensure the face is fully visible and preferably facing forward.

All setting choices made throughout the program are by using number inputs, without spaces or any additional digits. 

To display the image(s), or to shoe the webcam, the program will open a tab. To close the tab, press ESCAPE

Any other information and citations can be found in my google document.
