# SmileAi
Grade 12 final individual project. This program, using either a prebuilt AI or one I made, detects smiles in faces through either inputted images or facecam.
All setting choices made throughout the program are by using number inputs, without spaces or any additional digits. 
To close the opened window when the facecam is active, or when viewing images read by the program, press escape.
